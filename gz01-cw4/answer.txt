-- QUESTION 1
-TEST 3
Starting from time 13, it is cleary visible the bouncing effect between router 2
 and router 1, with the packet being sent back and forth on the same link
 several times.

After the link failure at time 35 the network is splitted into two parts:
 {0 2 1} and {6 5 4 3}.

Starting from time 51 there is bouncing+counting to infinity effect between
 routers 2 and 1.


-TEST 4
At time 30, the failure of the link (0,3) split the network  in two parts,
 {012} {34567}: this cause a bouncing + counting to infinity effect
between router 5 and 6.



-- QUESTION 2
-TEST 3
In this case, the SH/PR optimization has completely resolved the previous issues.

-TEST4
At time 41 there is a loop between routers {3 5 6}. The SH/PR optimization 
cannot prevent loops between more than 2 routers. However, the packet travels 
the loop only once before being dropped.
